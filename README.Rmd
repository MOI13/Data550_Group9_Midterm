### Report Overview

Children with medically complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) face a high risk of inpatient mortality. Factors such as diarrhea, carbohydrate malabsorption, and refeeding syndrome may contribute to early mortality and hinder recovery. [Bandsam et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002747) tested whether a lactose-free, low-carbohydrate F75 milk could mitigate these risks, potentially reducing the duration of the stabilization phase.

This project aims to replicate part of the analysis published in the article *A reduced-carbohydrate and lactose-free formulation for stabilization among hospitalized children with severe acute malnutrition: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial.*
